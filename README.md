## Description
This Social-Media-Network backend allows users to create accounts, thoughts, reactions, and add friends. They also have the ability to update their thoughts and accounts as users. 

This application also gives the user the ability to delete thoughts, users (their account), reactions (for their own thoughts or thoughts of their friends), and delete friends. There is also the ability to grab users or thoughts by their unique IDs, or grab all users and all thoughts. 

*Please check the necessary packages section to see what you need to install and do before running this application live. *

## Necessary packages 
Please run "npm install express", "npm install mongoose", and "npm install mongosh" in the terminal.

To start the server, please check your package.json "scripts" section and use what it says for "start." For myself, this is just npm start to run the live server. I am using windows 10 on a desktop computer.
